<p>Sneakbike has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5WLNGgGQH2tpNHM5uk2kCg">Youtube channel</a> , which we use to upload our VODs of our past Twitch broadcasts. We do a few edits on them before publishing them.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Upload Twitch VOD to Youtube. By default, uploaded videos are private until you publish them. You can always check the visibility of each video while in Youtube Studio mode and under the tab “Content."</li>
